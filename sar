sar collects and displays ALL system activities statistics.
sadc stands for “system activity data collector”. This is the sar backend tool that does the data collection.
sa1 stores system activities in binary data file. sa1 depends on sadc for this purpose. sa1 runs from cron.
sa2 creates daily summary of the collected statistics. sa2 runs from cron.
sadf can generate sar report in CSV, XML, and various other formats. Use this to integrate sar data with other tools.

iostat generates CPU, I/O statistics
mpstat displays CPU statistics.
pidstat reports statistics based on the process id (PID)
nfsiostat displays NFS I/O statistics.
cifsiostat generates CIFS statistics.
